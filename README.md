Find My Bazinga
===============

A useless python script that searches for a phrase in a set of movies and plays the parts where that phrase is spoken.

How to use
==========

Make a directory of all the movies you want to run `FindMyBazinga` on. Next, grab the movies' subtitles using a tool like [periscope](http://code.google.com/p/periscope/).

Run `python bazinga.py /path/to/movies/ PHRASE`, sit back and enjoy the show!
